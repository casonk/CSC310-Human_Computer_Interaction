In this prototype, the user can:
create projects
create a breakpoint on line 4 (either by clicking the 4 or by going Debug > Toggle Breakpoint)
run a debugger
step to the next line
save the file
create a header
remove a header
change compiler
view the manual
create a ribbon menu


The prototype is linear in that one cannot do these things out of order.

To do these things follow these instructions
Tasks for Users to complete and how to complete them (Users will only see the numbers that do not have the actual directions. The parentheses contain what will be said to the User.
